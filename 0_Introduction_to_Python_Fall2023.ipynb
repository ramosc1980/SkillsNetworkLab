Python is now one of the most popular programming languages. One recent survey of several thousand job listings for data scientists in Indeed, SimplyHired, and Monster reports that, among the top 15 technologies in demand, Python ranked first (Hale, 2019). In many firms in finance and banking, Python seems to be replacing Excel. Matthew Hampson, deputy chief digital officer at Nomura, stated that “[t]he concept of rapid innovation has always existed in financial services, but it was done using the Excel spreadsheet. We now have a new vehicle for doing that - Python.” (Butcher, 2019).\n",
